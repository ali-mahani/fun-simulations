# Module 1 -- The Sandpile Model
The one dimensional sandpile model was first introduced in an article by Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld (BTW);
where their goal was an introduction to the self-organized critical systems. This system is
also know as the *sandpile cellular automaton* and is a well know model.

Here I implement the model in python by making the `Sandpile` class.
