## This is a test to simulate a particle in 2D under the influence of a spring attached to the origin and a Magnetic field
The initial conditions are: -> the particle starts from (10, 10) coordinates with 0 velocity.

Running the python file requires _numpy_ and _matplotlib_ libraries installed.

One can run the code with `python Main.py` or make the file executable
with `chmod +x Main.py` and then run it with `./Main.py`.
