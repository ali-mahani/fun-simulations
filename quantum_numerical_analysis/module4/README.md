# Entanglement in the Stern-Gerlach Experiment
This time we turn our head toward the Stern-Gerlach experiment and try to have a more realistic view.
We consider the coordinates of the electron as well as its spin and find that the evolution of
the state with `z = 0` and spin up in the x-axis, is an entangled st
