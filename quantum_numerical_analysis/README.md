# Quantum Numerical Analysis
Here I discuss numerical analysis of the quantum mechanics problems using matrices and `numpy`.

# Module 1
Making the **X** space operator and the **P** momentum operator in the x space.
We also test the two methods for generating the momentum operator and compare them together.

Special thanks to my friend and Quantum Mechanics teacher assistant **"Alireza Negari"**.
