# Quantum Numerical Analysis
Here I discuss numerical analysis of the quantum mechanics problems using matrices and `numpy`.

## Module 1 -- The X and P operators
Making the **X** space operator and the **P** momentum operator in the x space.
We also test the two methods for generating the momentum operator and compare them together.

Special thanks to my friend and Quantum Mechanics teacher assistant **"Alireza Negari"**.

## Module 2 -- The 1D Hydrogen Atom
Here we solve the 1 dimensional hydrogen atom potential. The potential in the reduced units is
as follows: V(x) = -1 / (|x| - epsilon) where epsilon = 10 ^ -4 in the reduced units.

## Module 3 -- The Heisenberg Hamiltonian
Here I introduce the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and try extracting interesting data from it.
The Heisenberg Hamiltonian is one of the most interesting problem in Condensed Matter Physics.

## Module 4 -- Entanglement in the Stern-Gerlach Experiment
This time we turn our head toward the Stern-Gerlach experiment and try to have a more realistic view.
We consider the coordinates of the electron as well as its spin and find that the evolution of 
the state with `z = 0` and spin up in the x-axis, is an entangled state.
