# Quantum Numerical Analysis
Here I discuss numerical analysis of the quantum mechanics problems using matrices and `numpy`.

## Module 1
Making the **X** space operator and the **P** momentum operator in the x space.
We also test the two methods for generating the momentum operator and compare them together.

Special thanks to my friend and Quantum Mechanics teacher assistant **"Alireza Negari"**.

## Module 2
Here we solve the 1 dimensional hydrogen atom potential. The potential in the reduced units is
as follows: V(x) = -1 / (|x| - epsilon) where epsilon = 10 ^ -4 in the reduced units.
