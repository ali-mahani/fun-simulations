## Cobweb Maps
Consider the function `f(x, r) = x * r * (1 - x)`.
The code `cobweb.py` tries to plot the cobweb map of
the this hard-coded function and save it. You can 
change the function and the values of `r` to your liking
and experiment. The starting position of the cobweb is
random so you can run the code multiple times and get different 
figures, but the resulting conclusion from the plot is the same.
