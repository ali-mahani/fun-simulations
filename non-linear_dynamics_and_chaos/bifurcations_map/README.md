## Bifurcation Map
Consider the function `f(x, r) = r * x - x ^ 3`.
The code `chaos.py` simulates this system for `num` times and when the
system reaches equilibrium, it saves the latest results. It repeats
this process for a range of the variable `r`. The resulting plot is in
figure `bifurcation.jpg`.
