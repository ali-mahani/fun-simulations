# Non-linear Dynamics and Chaos

Here, we draw our attention to this subject and try to simulate and numerically solve systems of 
non-linear and chaotic nature.

### Henon Map
The Hénon map is a discrete-time dynamical system. It is one of the most studied examples of dynamical
systems that exhibit chaotic behavior. The Hénon map takes a point in the plane and maps it to a new point.
