# Non-linear Dynamics and Chaos

Here, we draw our attention to this subject and try to simulate and numerically solve systems of 
non-linear and chaotic nature.

### Henon Map
The Hénon map is a discrete-time dynamical system. It is one of the most studied examples of dynamical
systems that exhibit chaotic behavior. The Hénon map takes a point in the plane and maps it to a new point.

### Bifurcation Map
The bifurcation maps are generated by iterating a given function for many times until we reach a stability
point, and then repeating the process by varying the controlling parameter and then plotting the results.

### Cobweb Plots
Cobweb plot is a powerful tool that helps us visualize a map and gives us great intuition about the 
stability points and bifurcations in a map.
